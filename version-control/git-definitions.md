# Git Definitions:

* What is version control? Version Control is a system that keeps track of every change to a file over time. These early versions can be restored and are used by software developers for source code. 
* Why is it useful? Version Control tracks changes in your code and manages multiple authors.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a copy or variant of a code history unit. A branch is used for separating projects that once had a common code base and can be usefule for experimenting with code, without affecting the main trunk.
* What is a commit? A commit is the act of making a set of tentative or local changes permanent. 
* What makes a good commit message? A good commit message is specific to the location and type of change being made to the feature branch so that it can easily be located for debugging purposes.
* What is a merge conflict? When pulling or merging feature branches to a master or remote repository, errors are referred to as conflict (content), which leaves you with an index that contains versions from each feature branch and the master base. You will need to fix the conflicts in order to commit the changes to the repository.
