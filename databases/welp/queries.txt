Release 2: View a Many-to-Many Relationship

1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews, businesses, users WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

1|5|Five Stars!|6|2|6|Sushi World|2|Mandy|Kaling
2|3|the service was terrible!|1|3|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Angela|Jolie
3|4|the music was great!|3|4|3|The Beagle Nightclub|4|Steven|Wonder

2. Choose to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Mandy|Kaling|Sushi World|5|Five Stars!
Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|the service was terrible!
Steven|Wonder|The Beagle Nightclub|4|the music was great!
Bradford|Pitt|Amir's Towing|5|Five Stars!
Denzel|George|JoeBob's Sportz Barn|3|the service was terrible!
Angela|Jolie|Lotus Yoga|5|Five Stars!
Merryl|Streepman|Plumbing by Janet|5|Five Stars!

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT * FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND name="Lotus Yoga";

3|Angela|Jolie|4|Lotus Yoga|6|5|Five Stars!|4|3
